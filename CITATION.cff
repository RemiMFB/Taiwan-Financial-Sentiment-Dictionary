abstract: |
  This study aims to leverage Taiwanese financial news texts to develop classification models that identify commonly used news terms. 
  In addition, large language models (LLMs) are employed to assist in reviewing, expanding, and verifying the sentiment classification of these terms. 
  Unlike existing studies, this paper constructs classification lexicons for specific financial topics, such as economic conditions, monetary policy, 
  and interest rates, thereby addressing a gap in the literature. 
  Through a series of filtering processes, we selected 7,814 financial sentiment terms. 
  Comparison with existing sentiment dictionaries reveals that more than one-quarter of these commonly used financial terms are not included in current lexicons. 
  Using central bank press releases as out-of-sample texts and treating LLMs' classification results as the benchmark, 
  we compare the sentiment classification accuracy of different lexicons. 
  The results indicate that the financial sentiment lexicon developed in this study is more advantageous in terms of computational time and cost compared to LLMs. 
  Although its classification accuracy is slightly lower than that of LLMs, 
  it surpasses existing sentiment dictionaries. 
  Furthermore, sentiment indicators constructed using the lexicon developed in this study demonstrate significant explanatory and predictive power for various macroeconomic variables in Taiwan, 
  outperforming indicators derived from existing sentiment dictionaries. 
  Finally, we observe that topic-specific classification lexicons and sentiment indicators can capture semantic nuances in texts more precisely, 
  thereby enhancing the informational content derived from textual data.
